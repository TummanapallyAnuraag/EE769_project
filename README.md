# EE769_project
Implementation of DB-SCAN Algorithm from scratch

# Execultion
Please run the following command in terminal.
`python main.py`

```
Note: Double check that the branch which you are cloning or downloading is **master** branch
```

# Requirements
* numpy
* pandas
* MinMaxScaler (form SciKit learn)
* pyplot from matplotlib
* Axes3D from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

# About code
DBSCAN.py is the code for DBSCAN class and algorithm

# References
* We have gone through the code from this [Repo](https://github.com/madhug-nadig/Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-Scratch)

* The following [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) was helpful in understanding the Algorithm

* Slides from EE769 Lectures (2018)

# Data
We have implemented only DBSCAN algorithm from scratch, and tried to use this algorithm on a "GasEmissions" data of all sates in India
